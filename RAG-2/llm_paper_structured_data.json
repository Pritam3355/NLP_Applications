            "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabili- ties on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic, information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in todays digital landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kwai Keye-VL, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model en- gineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four- stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode cold-start data mixture, which includes thinking, non-thinking, auto-think, think with image, and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the KC-MMBench, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage. Comprehensive human evalua- tions also confirm that our model provides a superior user experience compared to other leading models of a similar scale. This paper details the architecture, data construction strategy, and training methodology of Keye-VL, offering valuable insights for building the next generation of MLLMs for the video era.",

(2025); Hu et al. (2025a)).",
            "Despite significant progress in understanding static images, a major challenge remains in comprehending video content (Shen et al. (2025); Lin et al. (2023)), which is more dynamic and information-dense (Luo et al. (2024c); Team et al. (2025a)). Short-form videos, in particular, become the primary medium for communication, entertainment, and commerce on platforms like Kuaishou( Zhou et al. (2025); Lu et al. (2025)). Understanding short videos is far more complex than recognizing individual objects (Li et al. (2024)); it requires a model to deeply comprehend the sequence of events, causal relationships, and the overall narrative. Furthermore, the model must integrate information from multiple sources, including video frames and audio (converted to text via Automatic Speech Recognition). Most existing multimodal models, primarily designed for handling combinations of single images and text, lack deep exploration for video tasks and thus often fail to capture the rich, contextual, and sequential information present in videos. To address this critical gap, we introduce Kwai Keye-VL, a meticulously engineered 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model. It achieves leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while also maintaining robust capabilities in general-purpose vision-language tasks (as shown in Figure 1). Our work is driven by a pressing need for a model that not only \"sees\" the world but also thinks about its dynamic patterns. This is crucial for enhancing user experience and enabling more intelligent applications in content creation, recommendation, and e-commerce on video-centric platforms.",
            "The development of Kwai Keye-VL rests upon several core techniques. First, we construct a large- scale and diverse dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens, with a special focus on high-quality video data. This data undergoes a rigorous processing pipeline, including filtering, re-captioning with advanced models to generate more precise descriptions, and frame-level annotation to ensure quality. Second, we design an innovative training methodology, which includes a four-stage pre-training process to build a solid foundation for vision-language alignment. Following pre-training, we further enhance Keye-VLs capabilities through a two-phase post-training process:",
            " Stage 1: optimizing foundational capabilities: We focus on improving the models basic performance in areas like instruction following. This is achieved through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO) on high-quality data.",
            " Stage 2: stimulating and enhancing reasoning abilities: We begin by creating high-quality \"cold-start\" data containing five modes: conventional question-answering, long chain-of-thought, auto-reasoning decision, \"think with an image\" (e.g., generating code to process images), and high-quality video data. We train the model on a mix of these modes, teaching it to select the most appropriate response style. This allows it to think deeply for complex reasoning tasks while responding quickly to simple ones. Subsequently, we employ reinforcement learning to further strengthen its complex reasoning skills. Finally, we use the MPO algorithm for several rounds of iterative alignment to correct issues such as repetitive outputs and flawed logical reasoning.",
            "Throughout both pre-training and post-training, we perform rigorous data de-duplication. We compare our training data against general benchmark samples and remove those with high similarity. This process also reveals several public datasets currently implicated in significant data leakage, which we argue should be avoided in model training.",
            "To validate our approachs effectiveness, we first conduct extensive evaluations on multiple public bench- marks. As Figure 1 shows, Keye-VLs performance is highly competitive in general image understanding and reasoning, even reaching state-of-the-art level. In video understanding, Keye-VL-8B substantially out- performs previous state-of-the-art models across several benchmarks. To specifically address short-video understanding, we also develop and open-source the Kuaishou Community Multimodal Benchmark (KC-MMBench) and a comprehensive internal evaluation suite to rigorously assess the models capabili- ties in realistic, video-centric commercial application scenarios. On this benchmark, Keye-VL-8B also demonstrates a significant advantage, highlighting its value for commercial applications.",

            "In past years, many MLLMs efforts have adopted the well-trained fixed-resolution ViTs as their vision encoders, such as ViT-bigG (Cherti et al. (2023) ), SigLIP-400M (Zhai et al. (2023)) and others. However, unlike pre-trained CLIP-based ViTs (Radford et al. (2021) ) that only handle coarse-grained image-caption matching task during training, MLLMs often tackle various finer-grained generation tasks, existing a large gap between them. Therefore, we anticipate that our ViT will possess the following capabilities: during processing, images and videos maintain their structural integrity and all details are preserved.",
            "To this end, there are some pioneer MLLMs exploring native-resolution ViT in recent years, such as Qwen2.5-VL, Seed-VL-1.5, Kimi-VL, etc. In Keye-VL, we also implement a native-resolution ViT, to naturally process images at original resolution, avoiding some complex and redundant image splic- ing/splitting operations (e.g., MiniCPM2 (Yao et al. (2024))). Specifically, our ViT is initialized by the SigLIP-400M-384-14, a fixed-resolution variant with absolute learnable position embeddings to inject the spatial information. According to it, we first employ interpolation techniques to extend fixed- length learnable position embeddings into resolution-adaptive position embeddings, enabling our basic native-resolution modeling while preserving the pretrained workflow. Afterwards, to further enhance extrapolation capabilities for positional encoding along visual dimensions, we introduce 2D Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to strengthen the visual information modeling. In our trial experience, we observe that incorporating 2D RoPE significantly improves the models performance on high-resolution image. Finally, building upon the two types of position embeddings, we incorporate the NaViT packing with FlashAttention techniques to continue training our ViT across images with varying resolutions.",
            "During the ViT pre-training procedure, we optimize our native-resolution modifications via SigLIP loss function (the text tower is also from SigLIP-400M-384-14). We use the same distribution data as the downstream MLLM for training, including a total of 500B Tokens from open source data DataComp (Gadre et al. (2023)), LAION (Schuhmann et al. (2022)), CC12M (Changpinyo et al. (2021)), PD12M (Meyer et al. (2024)), COCO (Lin et al. (2014)) and other in-house data.",

            "For images of different resolutions, we set the total number of tokens for each image to 16384, which can cover images with more than one million pixels and is sufficient to help the model to see the details of the image in most scenarios. For video modeling, we devise a dynamic resolution strategy that balances the maximum number of frames and the total number of tokens. In Keye-VL, we currently set the min/max token number per frame as 128/768, and the max vision token as 24576, this setting can automatically make trade-off between the breadth and depth of visual perception. Subsequently, based on the extracted frames, we re-calculate the FPS and ensure strict alignment in the time position in 3D RoPE dimensions during training (position +1 corresponds to +0.5 second in real world). Meanwhile, we are exploring other more efficient frame modeling techniques to ensure that more frames could feed to our LLM with acceptable computation.",

Generally, our training data encompasses six primary categories: Image Caption, OCR & VQA, Grounding & Counting, Interleaved, Video Understanding and Pure Text data. To ensure these overall data quality, we have designed customized filtering mechanisms tailored to the characteristics of each data category. For large volumes of medium-quality data, we employ CLIP (Radford et al. (2021)) scores for preliminary filtering. For smaller amounts of high-quality data, we utilize open-source MLLMs as discriminators for data selection. Additionally, we also conduct rigorous image-based deduplication operation, to avoid the potential data leakage between our training corpus and evaluation benchmarks (Dixit et al. (2021)).

In practice, to ensure data quality, we retain high-similarity image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP score > 0.9) while leveraging filtered low-quality open-source image data and our in-house image data through a re-captioning pipeline. During the re-caption, we utilize several MLLMs (Qwen2.5-VL 72B (Bai et al. (2025)), Tarsier2 (Yuan et al. (2025)), GPT-4o (Hurst et al. (2024)), Gemini1.5-pro (Team et al.

            "and reasoning across mathematics, science, charts, and complex OCR domains. The intuition behind this data construction is to create a high-frequency or commonly traversed thinking path for each data point, ensuring accuracy in the long-CoT process. To achieve this, we employ a sophisticated construction process: 1) We use MLLMs to sample multiple CoT paths for each data point. 2) These paths undergo evaluation by another model for correctness in both steps and final results, with only correct samples retained. 3) We identify common, high-repetition thinking steps within these processes and score them based on frequency. 4) Finally, high-frequency thinking processes are identified as complete, high-quality reasoning paths, or high-scoring steps are combined to synthesize new, high-probability paths. The thinking data is supplemented with a long-CoT text dataset generated by sampling responses from another LLM across five domains: code, mathematics, science, instruction following, and reasoning.",
            "Auto-Think data: Sourced from datasets including MMPR, MM-Eureka (Meng et al. (2025)), and OpenR1- Math (Hu et al. (2025a)), this component trains the model to autonomously determine when to engage its reasoning module. For each prompt, a MLLM first analyzes complexity. Complex prompts trigger responses in a \"think + answer\" format, while simpler ones receive direct answers. The final training sample comprises the initial analysis, thinking process (for complex cases only), and final answer.",
            "Agentic data: This set of 100,000 samples enables the models think with image capability through coding. Our three-stage construction process creates diverse data that teaches models to manipulate images and perform calculations via code. First, from 3 million QA pairs, the Qwen 2.5 VL-72B model identifies questions where image operations (cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) could simplify problems or improve answer quality; the model is then asked to generate corresponding analysis and code. The code will be validated in an external sandbox and the generated image will be checked by another MLLM to ensure code usability. Second, because public datasets rarely contain images requiring rotation or contrast enhancement, to counteract cropping bias, we manually construct low-contrast OCR tasks and artificially rotate images, training the model to write code for contrast enhancement or rotation operations before providing final results, ensuring the model learns more than just cropping and magnifi- cation. Third, for mathematical problems, Gemini-2.5-pro generates step-by-step thinking processes, then GPT-4o transforms complex calculations into executable code, broadening the agents functional scope from image operations to calculation verification. Through these data, the model can perform various image operations (cropping, rotation, magnification, contrast enhancement) via code generation while simultaneously conducting or verifying complex calculations to enhance computational accuracy.",
            "Video data: We have carefully collected a diverse set of video data, encompassing categories such as daily natural videos, movie clips, social media short videos, gaming videos, and educational videos. Among these, there are 24,000 samples labeled as Thinking data and 80,000 samples as Non-Thinking data. The annotation methods and task types can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) various task data directly obtained and filtered from open-source datasets; (2) manually annotated data covering action classification, temporal relationships, and VQA tasks; and (3) tasks constructed using rule-based approaches that focus on temporal modelingfor example, extracting six frames from a video, randomly shuffling their order, and requiring the model to predict the original sequence. These tasks collectively enhance the models understanding of temporal relationships within videos.",
            "Training strategy: All of the above data are combined during training. Notably, for video samples, we individually sample both 16 and 32 frames per example to participate in training, thereby improving the models robustness to varying video frame counts. Considering that Long-CoT data primarily targets complex multi-step reasoning tasks with an emphasis on logical inference and process explainability, while Instruct data aligns more closely with everyday usage scenarios that require quick and clear responses, their combination fosters structured thinking for complex tasks while preserving stylistic di- versity and flexibility for open-ended tasks. Furthermore, incorporating auto-think and agentic data into mixed training not only boosts model performance in mathematical problem-solving, logical reasoning, and visual perception but also enables flexible output strategy selection according to different user needs. This integration ultimately leads to stronger generalization capabilities and better alignment with human preferences. As a result, the model simultaneously supports the /think, /no_think, /auto_think, and /agentic_think functionalities.",

This not only reduces per-device memory pressure by sharding optimizer states, gradients, and parameters, but more critically, it enables effective computation-communication overlap.

For instance, a sequence of 196 patches may correspond to multiple distinct spatial configurations (e.g., 1414, 728, or 287), leading to ambiguous spatial localization during feature projection. (2) With 2D RoPE modification, our ViT could clearly perceive the shape of the image, and showing competitive results with Base SigLIP performance (the best and runner-up results).

            "In video-centric scenarios, Keye-VL demonstrates superior capabilities compared to other open-source models. Our evaluations on both public and internal benchmarks indicate that an accurate understanding of video content is one of Keye-VLs core strengths. On public video benchmarks, Keye-VL significantly outperforms other models in both modes, particularly on Video-MMMU, with an absolute improvement of 8.7% in thinking mode. On LongVideoBench, auto-think mode surpasses thinking mode by 2%, this indicates that Keye-VL has sufficiently extracted video information on the input side, allowing it to obtain the correct answer without excessive reasoning.",
            "To better evaluate the short-form video understanding capabilities of Keye-VL, we construct and open- source the Kuaishou Community Multimodal Benchmark (KC-MMBench in Table 4)4. This benchmark assesses model performance across several key dimensions of short-form video comprehension and has undergone rigorous manual inspection and data anonymization. On KC-MMBench, Keye-VL achieves an average accuracy of 68.03%, substantially surpassing the second-best model, MiMo-VL 7B-RL, which attains an accuracy of 57.62%. This highlights the effectiveness and application potential of Keye-VL in the domain of short-form video understanding.",

            "Despite extensive evaluations on a wide array of public benchmarks, these benchmarks exhibit numerous limitations that necessitate a focused effort on developing a proprietary, internal evaluation suite. The primary issues are as follows:",
            " Benchmark contamination: An unavoidable limitation of public datasets is the potential for their data to have been inadvertently or deliberately exposed during the models training process. This phenomenon, known as benchmark contamination, can lead to exaggerated performance metrics, reduc- ing the sensitivity of public benchmarks to subtle model improvements and thus failing to reflect the models capabilities. To obtain a reliable assessment of a models genuine performance, it is imperative to construct an internal evaluation benchmark that is insulated from training data contamination.",
            " Limited language coverage: The majority of public benchmarks are predominantly focused on English- language scenarios. This significantly constrains the exploration of a models abilities within the context of native Chinese applications. English benchmarks are incapable of adequately covering or measuring the unique expressions, profound cultural contexts, and diverse local needs inherent to the Chinese language environment. Therefore, building a benchmark that can effectively evaluate a models Chinese language capabilities is of paramount importance.",
            " Insufficient task and domain coverage: Existing general-purpose evaluation benchmarks primarily concentrate on fundamental perception and simple reasoning abilities. They fail to comprehensively cover a multi-dimensional spectrum of capabilities, including fine-grained perception, cross-modal ground- ing, language modeling, complex reasoning, and safety & robustness. Furthermore, current benchmarks lack a focus on real-world application scenarios, particularly core business needs such as multimodal understanding in short video communities. This deficiency results in an evaluation framework that cannot effectively reflect a models performance in practical business tasks, severely hindering the assessment of its practical value and potential for deployment.",
            " Monotonous task difficulty and evaluation format: The task types and question formats (e.g., true/- false, multiple-choice, fixed-answer questions) in existing benchmarks are relatively simple and uniform. They are insufficient for comprehensively measuring a models capacity to handle complex, open-ended question answering, which more closely mirrors authentic user interactions. Constructing a more challenging evaluation benchmark that supports open-ended generative responses is better suited to simulate real-world user and business interactions, thereby enabling a more accurate assessment of the models generalization capabilities in practical scenarios.",

            "performance on fundamental dimensions such as fluency and relevance at a level comparable to industry- leading models, while establishing a distinct competitive edge in complex video tasks requiring deep reasoning and divergent thinking. Importantly, the successful application of this multidimensional scoring framework not only validates the models leading position but also underscores the unique value of the evaluation methodology in penetrating surface-level performance metrics to directly assess core capabilities and user experience.",
            "Keye-VL-8B effectively transfers and excels in image domain tasks: Keye-VL-8B extends its capabilities from video to the static image domain, achieving the top ranking on the image subset with a composite score of 3.81. Its core metrics, including Correctness (4.05) and Comprehensiveness (4.49), also lead the industry. This indicates the models VQA abilities are both reliable and comprehensive. Notably, we observe an intriguing performance profile: unlike other models whose Creativity scores generally increase on image tasks, our model exhibits a inferior performance in this dimension (3.69). We interpret this not as a deficiency but as a reflection of a deliberate design focus. It further emphasizes Keye-VL-8Bs is weighted toward complex dynamic relational reasoning rather than creative generation on static images.",
            "The model shows strong foundational strengths in key video capabilities: To further dissect the models specific competencies on video tasks, we perform a fine-grained breakdown of capability dimensions. As detailed in Table 6, Keye-VL-8B attains the highest scores among all evaluated models in three fundamental areas: Visual Element Recognition (3.89), (Prior Knowledge-Based) Question Answering (2.78), and Robustness (3.50). Additionally, it demonstrates competitive strength in Temporal Information Understanding (2.92), closely matching the leading contenders. These results strongly evidence that our model has established a solid foundation in core perceptual and cognitive pathways for video understanding, enabling more accurate and reliable parsing of objective video content. In contrast, some competitors show superior performance in reasoning, creative generation, and domain-specific knowledge dimensions that rely more heavily on large language model generation capabilities. We believe these differences reflect divergent development paths: Keye-VL-8B prioritizes ensuring correct and stable visual world understanding, thereby laying a firm groundwork for future improvements in trustworthiness and capability ceilings on more complex reasoning and interactive tasks.",
            "The model also achieves a significant leading edge in Basic Description (4.0), Visual Recognition (3.97), and Visual Comprehension (3.70) of the image subtasks. Particularly remarkable is the models decisive lead on the complex task of Multi-Image Analysis (3.15). We attribute this advantage directly to the models deep understanding of correlations across multiple frames, developed through extensive training on massive short video data. This ability to handle temporal information has effectively generalized into analyzing spatial and logical relationships across multiple static images. This finding not only validates our technical approach but also reveals the unique advantage derived from video-based training, endowing the model with powerful potential for handling complex visual inputs.",
            "6.3.4 Analysis of Kwai Keye-VLs Limitations",
            "Although our model demonstrates competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, we have identified several limitations. These limitations not only reveal areas for improvement in the current model but also guide our directions for the next phase of iterative enhancement.",
            "1. Core visual perception capability: The primary challenge lies in the precise recognition of key visual elements in complex scenes. Specifically, the model still exhibits a non-negligible error rate in OCR, especially for Chinese characters, when processing images containing dense or stylized text. Furthermore, for fine-grained recognition taskssuch as accurately distinguishing specific species of animals or plants, identifying detailed clothing items on persons, or differentiating subtle variations of objectsthe model occasionally confuses or misidentifies targets. Regarding information completeness, the model sometimes omits secondary objects or partial textual information within images, indicating that its ability to build a comprehensive understanding of the scene needs strengthening.",
            "2. Temporal understanding in video processing: Our analysis indicates that the model exhibits instability when describing coherent temporal action sequences, particularly in distinguishing between coarse- grained and fine-grained semantic levels of actions. Additionally, the models perception of cinematic language, such as camera movements and viewpoint shifts, remains relatively weak. It also shows potential for improvement in tasks requiring precise localization of events within video timelines, temporal ordering, tracking object changes, and motion trajectories. These shortcomings constrain the models ability to perform deep and coherent analysis of video content.",
            "3. Higher-order cognitive and reasoning capability: The models reliability declines on problems that demand rigorous logical chains or mathematical calculations. In question involving specialized domain knowledge (e.g., professional disciplines, well-known intellectual properties), the model occasionally produces factual inaccuracies or omissions. Furthermore, although the model performs well in creative",

            "We provide a selection of qualitative examples illustrating the capabilities of the Kwai Keye-VL model in various aspects. Our presentation is divided into two dimensions: Modality and Thinking Mode. In Appendix C.1, we demonstrate the Kwai Keye-VL models capabilities in pure text (Appendix C.1.1), images (Appendix C.1.2), and videos (Appendix C.1.3), including public benchmark cases and business scenario cases. In Appendix C.2, we showcase the two thinking modes of the Kwai Keye-VL model: Agentic Thinking (Appendix C.2.1) and Auto Thinking (Appendix C.2.2).",
            "7 Discussion",
            "7.1 Mutual Enhancement between Reasoning and Non-Reasoning Data",
            "As discussed in Section 4.2.1, following the non-reasoning stage, we introduce the CoT-Mix dataset to cold-start Keye-VLs reasoning capabilities. During this phase, Keye-VL acquires proficiency in both the Non-Thinking and Thinking modes. We evaluate the impact of Step II.1 (cold start with CoT-Mix data) by comparing Keye-VLs performance before and after this training stage. In the Non-Thinking and Thinking modes, Keye-VLs performance improves by 5.67% and 8.22% on MMMU, and by 2.95% and 7.97% on HallucinationBench, respectively. These results demonstrate that training on CoT-Mix data strengthens both perceptual and reasoning abilities. Furthermore, since similar non-reasoning data is also employed during Steps I.1 and I.2, the observed performance gains in the Non-Thinking mode are primarily attributable to the inclusion of long CoT reasoning data. This suggests that the integration of long CoT data also enhances the models capability in the Non-Thinking mode, which aligns with recent findings reported in ERNIE 4.5 ( Team (2025b)).",
            "On MathVista, Keye-VLs accuracy increases by -1.1% (Non-Thinking) and 7.9% (Thinking), suggesting that the model spontaneously establishes the connection between the Thinking mode and complex logical reasoning. Based on this observation, we introduce Auto-Think mode in step II.2 to further enhance Keye-VLs ability to select reasoning modes based on difficulty and improve overall performance.",
            "7.2 Performance Gain from RL Training",
            "How to synchronously and stably improve the models performance across various tasks is one of the core challenges of RL. In Step II.2 (Section 4.2.2), we attempt to achieve this by adopting the Mix-Mode strategy. In our conception, Non-Thinking and Thinking Modes are respectively suitable for simple and complex tasks. Therefore, during the RL process, we apply Keye-VL to generate samples using a mix of both two modes to comprehensively enhance its performance across various tasks, and we incorporate the Auto-Think mode as we discussed before.",
            "The evaluation results show that after RL training, Keye-VL achieves an average improvement of 1.44%/2.17% in Non-Thinking/Thinking mode across 10 benchmarks. Its performance increase by 0%/0.93% to 4.18%/5.73% on 9 benchmarks, with a decrease of only 1.11%/1.2% on MMMU/OCRBench. This indicates that mix-mode RL strategy achieves a comprehensive and synchronous improvement.",

            "To evaluate Keye-VLs ability to spontaneously select the reasoning mode by task type and difficulty, we calculate the proportions of Keye-VL choosing the Thinking mode during Auto-Think inference across four different benchmarks (Table 7). It turns out that on the more challenging and logic-reasoning-oriented MAthVista and MMStar, Keye more frequently selects the Thinking mode. However, Non-Thinking remains the predominant mode, as the difficulty of most samples is limited. On the HallusionBench, Keye-VL selects the Thinking mode only in few instances. In these cases, Keye-VL engages in reflection to",

            "In this work, we present Kwai Keye-VL, a model that achieves leading video understanding capabilities through high-quality video data construction during both pre-training and post-training phases. The mix-mode training in the post-training phase further enables Keye-VL to respond more flexibly, resulting in superior user experience. Public benchmarks and internal human evaluations demonstrate Keye-VLs strong performance in general image-text understanding, logical reasoning, and short video applications.",
            "Nevertheless, Keye-VL has room for improvement. First, we have not specifically optimized the video encoder architecture or video encoding strategies, leaving significant potential for future enhancements. Second, Keye-VLs perceptual capabilities show only modest advantages compared to SOTA models, and its think with image ability remains preliminary, still lagging behind OpenAIs O3 model. Finally, our use of an additional MLLM as a direct reward model introduces limitations in reliability and usability due to the MLLMs inherent instruction-following capabilities and computational costs. Developing more reliable and efficient reward modeling strategies remains an open question for future research.",

            "To prevent benchmark leakage (i.e., the model memorizes evaluation examples), we conduct rigorous data decontamination strategies to avoid the data leakage problem. In pre-training, considering the large-scale data volume, we utilize simple-yet-effective pHash&minHash techniques to check our data corpus. We apply a decontamination process based on pHash and minHash. First, we utilize pHash to generate a 64-bit binary string, then convert its ones ID location list to build minHash index via 128-bit permutation hashing to group them. Next, the same buckets candidate pairs are verified using Jaccard similarity (>0.95) to identify complex variations like partial crops or local edits. Considering that some training samples have multiple images, but as long as one image is repeated with the benchmark, we will also filter out the sample from our training data. In Table 8, we have listed some open-source datasets that may have data leaks.",

Pairs exceeding similarity thresholds of 0.98 (image) and 0.50 (text) to any benchmark sample are excluded, preserving semantic diversity while systematically removing evaluation look-alikes.",

Therefore: [ Area of the shaded region = 37R?  har = 370(R? _ r) ] Substituting (R*  7? = 4), we get: [ Area of the shaded region = 4m x4= 27] In conclusion, the area of the shaded region is (| 27 |). </answer>",
